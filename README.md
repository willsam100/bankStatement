# bankStatement

Used to analyze bank transactions in the form of a CSV. Transactions are assigned into categories to help identify the types of expenditure that has occured. 
Totals are also calcuated for the period (Usually 1 month) and also for each category. 

One particualar goal of this project was to make it easy to add categories and transaction entries. 
Adding categories is done by adding an entry to the categoires funciton. 
Different functions can be added to allow for different types of transactions to be identifed, eg descriptionContainsWords for expenditure with transaction containing text or isIncome to identify income.

TODO: Update file names as the project structure was started from another project.
